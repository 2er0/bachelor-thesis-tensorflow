Routing is a daily demand and is used within our navigation-systems like \textit{Google Maps}. 
The navigation solution contains the functionality to find \textit{point-to-point} routes with fixed sequence stops. 
The field of transport systems/logistics requires a more sophisticated stop optimiziation. 
As an example the package delivery service UPS uses stop und routing optimiziation to save millions of costs. 

\noindent
This thesis contains the basics about the \textit{Traveling Salesman Problem} and its offsprings. 
Additionally it includes the basics to the solving approaches for these problems and how they work. 
There is an implementation of the \textit{Savings-Algorithm} with the time window extension.
